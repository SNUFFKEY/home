    <h1>Hello People ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>Hey its me Keenan again and I am back with another blog. Today I plan on doing 3 rooms of TryHackeMe like usual but apart from my daily TryHackMe grind I plan on doing one other thing. Your probably wondering what that thing is and I am gonna tell you well are you ready , ok well I like men. Nah nah just kidding but for real the thing I plan on doing is starting my journey to learn how to use different pentesting tools like (Hashcat,JohnTheRipper,Hydra,Burp Suite,Metasploit,and Wireshark) effectively.</p>

    <h2>How do I plan on achieving this ?</h2>
    <p>Well obviously I cant become an expert with these tools in just one day and I dont plan to.So I am planning on just practicing and playing around with these tools maybe an hour out of my day to really get them edged in brain and to promote comfortability with them.In the small chance somebody is reading this article add my discord (damson1234) and give me any recommendations or tips on getting better with these tools.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Well thats about it boys and gals its time for me to add a smart fridge to my botnet! </p>
