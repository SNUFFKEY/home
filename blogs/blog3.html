<h1> Greetings Humans </h1>
  <p>Hey its MrDyspo47 or Keenan again and today I will 
 be talking about my a new goal I have for the future.I know nobody is gonna read this article for like the next couple of months or so ,but I still wanted to get it out there. My goal for the future is to reach the top 2,000 in 
the TryHackMe leaderboards by the end of this year.</p>

  <h2>How will I achieve this ?</h2>
  <p>I plan on achieving this goal by doing 3 rooms everyday on weekdays and 5-8 for each day in the weekend. I would try to do more rooms ,but since I have school and other things like a coding competition this will have to do.</p>

  <h2>Another Goal</h2>
  <p>Another goal that I also wanted to achieve is to maintain a 300 day streak on TryHackMe. Some people might be saying I am a tryhard and you wouldn't be entirely wrong. I really want to become a "made guy" in the hacking community , so I am willing to put the work necessary to achieve my goal.</p>
